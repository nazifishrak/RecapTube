# **RecapTube: Unwind the Content, Rewind the Knowledge**

## **Inspiration: A Personal Struggle**

*It's exam time, and the pressure is on. As you sit down to study, you realize you've fallen back into your old habits – trying to grasp new topics at the last minute through YouTube. We've all been there, spending precious time searching for the right video, taking notes, and struggling to focus on understanding the content. That's why our team embarked on a mission to transform this learning process with RecapTube.*

*Our journey began with a shared struggle – trying to absorb information from YouTube videos while juggling note-taking. It was a challenge familiar to many students: the need to multitask during crucial study sessions. We decided it was time to simplify this process and make learning more efficient.*

## **Building RecapTube: Streamlining the Learning Experience**

*RecapTube is a web app designed to streamline the note-taking process for YouTube videos. By generating notes with a single click, eliminates the hassle of multitasking and allows users to focus solely on understanding the video content. Additionally, the app introduces a unique feature – a follow-up question box powered by a Language Model (LLM). Users can ask specific questions related to the video and receive real-time answers, enhancing the learning experience.*

## **How RecapTube Helps:**

*Traditionally, YouTube has been a one-way learning platform where users passively consume content. RecapTube breaks this mold by allowing users to interact with video content directly. It transforms YouTube into an interactive learning experience, providing instant help and engagement. Here is what RecapTube offers:*

- *Focus on understanding: Users can concentrate on listening and comprehending the video without the distraction of note-taking.*
  
- *Efficient note generation: Notes are generated with a single click, saving valuable study time.*
  
- *Real-time answers: The follow-up question box provides instant answers related to the video content, eliminating the need to search for additional resources.*
  
- *Centralized organization: Users have all their notes and questions in one place, avoiding the hassle of managing separate documents.*

## **Challenges Faced: Learning and Growing**

*Building RecapTube came with its set of challenges. Implementing the UI for the follow-up question box proved to be a hurdle, especially in achieving a design inspired by ChatGPT's UI. Server requests for obtaining answers were sometimes slow, impacting the real-time display of notes. Creating an interactive question and answer box posed another challenge, with difficulties in API setup and outdated documentation.*

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

*Throughout the development process, our team learned valuable lessons: working with APIs, integrating backend and frontend features, managing server requests, and adapting when faced with obstacles. Despite limitations in picture integration, compatibility with non-transcripted videos, and complexities with math/physics-related content, RecapTube remains a powerful tool with room for improvement.*

## **What's next for RecapTube**

*RecapTube is just the beginning. While challenges exist, our commitment to creating an intuitive and user-friendly tool remains unwavering. Future steps include refining the UI, addressing compatibility issues, and exploring ways to enhance the user experience.*

*Embark on your learning journey with RecapTube – where understanding takes center stage, and learning becomes a seamless, efficient process.*
